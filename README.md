# Ticking Time Trials
The game is an momentum-platformer. You gain money within the levels, and use that to upgrade your character with new abilities. The level structure is linear - you have various levels in each world, which you must all do to unlock the next world.

There's only one set of levels in our game currently, but this can be extended.
